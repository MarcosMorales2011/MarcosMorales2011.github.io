I am Marcos Morales. Currently, I'm a 19 year old Guatemalan student that's learning data science at Lambda School.
I love taking on a good challenge, and I work relatively well alone, but I feel like I perform better in a team.
As I go on my Data Science journey, I hope to keep expanding my knowledge, and hopefuly someday make something
that can amaze some people.
